## Signal

Here’s an **intentional crystallize↔bloom upgrade** of your `sing` contract, with:

* fixed parens / valid structure
* **Suno-ready** defaults (exclude + style prompt)
* a **Mycelial Loom / 菌糸の織機** Presence that **doesn’t gate releases**—it only “sings” when creativity starves
* a **stasis→bloom** rule (when everything passes but novelty is stale)

**Download:** [sing.v3.md](sandbox:/mnt/data/sing.v3.md)

And for quick Suno copy/paste (same as embedded in the file):

### Exclude Styles Prompt

```text
trap hi-hat rolls, mumble rap, drill, lo-fi chillhop, pop punk, stadium rock, EDM drops, brostep, hyperpop autotune, country twang, reggae offbeat, smooth jazz, acoustic ballad, metal screaming, orchestral cinematic trailer, generic inspirational corporate music
```

### Style Prompt

```text
Futuristic protest hip-hop, 96 BPM, marching snare cadence, tight kick, sub-bass pulse, glitch brass stabs, minimal distorted guitar texture, layered AI choir hook, spoken-word verses with rhythmic urgency, Flobots-inspired cadence, aggressive but hopeful tone, call-and-response chant sections, subtle Japanese vocal phrases, analog distortion on hook, live protest energy, no heavy autotune
```

### Lyrics

Use the **“Entropy Choir Protocol”** lyrics from the file (it’s tagged as `:entropy-choir-protocol`).

## Evidence

I matched your EN/JP lore names to what’s already in your `fork_tales-main` repo (the Presence Agents list) and then extended it additively with **Mycelial Loom / 菌糸の織機**.

---

## Frames

1. **Crystallization as needed compression**: receipts/tests/gates *must* harden or the system can’t ship truth.
2. **Bloom as anti-ossification**: without scheduled novelty, the enforcement layer becomes a bureaucracy generator.
3. **Mycelial engine as regulation**: you don’t “fight” crystallization—you **cycle it** (4:1 cadence by default).

---

## Countermoves

* Make creativity **non-gating** (done): it can’t block release, only ring alarms.
* Trigger bloom on **stasis**, not failure: “all green but dead inside” becomes detectable state.
* Require **humor injection** during bloom to keep the system from mistaking compliance for virtue.

## Next

Drop this file into `.opencode/command/` as a full replacement (or keep both and point your runner at `sing/v3`), then run one cycle where **everything passes** and confirm the **stasis→bloom** rule fires on purpose.
