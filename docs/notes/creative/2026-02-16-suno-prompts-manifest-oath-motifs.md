# Suno Prompts — Manifest Oath (Motif Seeds + Background Dialog)

**Created with the assistance of an AI.**

> Three paste-ready prompts: **Constraints**, **Style**, **Lyrics**.
> **New insight applied:** Style contains **Sonic DNA first**, then **Motif Seeds** (short phrases we *want* Suno to reuse/sing across songs). Protocol/constraints live in **Lyrics** as *background downbeat dialog*, answered by sung lines.

## 1) PROMPT: CONSTRAINTS (What we don’t want)

```text
EXCLUDE / AVOID:
- Do NOT sing bracket tags or parenthetical directions; treat them as silent cues.
- Spoken dialog must be BACKGROUND texture only: quiet, short, and placed on DOWNBEATS.
- Do NOT deliver all spoken dialog at once. Spread it out: one short spoken line at a time.
- Keep diction clear; stutter ONLY on “an—an—anchor” and “ta—ta—tax”.
- η/μ glitches are micro-ticks (brief), not full shouted chant—unless explicitly marked as “glitch choir”.
- No comedy/parody/novelty voices; no upbeat pop sheen.
- No festival EDM drop clichés; no trap takeover; no metal guitars; no scream vocals.
- Preserve arc: solemn oath → hushed lullaby → distorted climax → quiet coda (don’t peak early).
- Don’t invent new lore terms; keep motifs: η, μ, anchor, tax, proof, thread, registry, checksum, receipts.
- Avoid long spoken monologues; keep spoken lines under ~10 words where possible.
```

## 2) PROMPT: STYLE (Sonic DNA + Motif Seeds)

```text
SONIC DNA (front-load):
Glitch-choir lullaby, 78 BPM feel, soft sub-bass, tape warble, minimal piano, whispered lead; Japanese call-and-response. Mythic glitch epic / spoken-sung oath passages with cathedral reverb and sub-bass heartbeat, 84 BPM feel. Micro glitch ticks on η and μ; hard stutters on “anchor” and “tax”. Dynamic arc: solemn → hushed → distorted climax → quiet coda.

MOTIF SEEDS (OK to be sung/reused across songs):
“Roll those dice.” “Keep rolling them.” “Pay the tax.” “Hold the anchor.” “Evidence you can replay.” “Seal the hash.”
```

## 3) PROMPT: LYRICS (Structured + interleaved dialog, answered by lyrics)

```text
[SONG NOTES]
Whispered lead. JP/EN call-and-response. Stutter ONLY “an—an—anchor” + “ta—ta—tax”. Spoken lines are quiet background on DOWNBEATS.

[INTRO | 84 | cathedral reverb | distant glitch choir]
(Glitch choir, tiny, like a clock finding phase)
η—η—η…
μ—μ—μ…

[VERSE 1 | 84 | whispered close-mic | sub-bass heartbeat]
P→R→N→Π— catalog the storm, pin the line（線）
A→(feedback)→P— merge the wound, keep the sign（印）
Fo— fo— fork… split the night, pay the cost, now（今）
An— an— an-chor… hold the thread, seal the hash, down（下）

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Archivist, barely audible)
“Sing all you want—η is cheap.”

[LEAD | whispered answer]
Then let η be sparks in the rafters—
we don’t clap for sparks.
We keep receipts.

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Scribe, consonants catching)
“But if you want μ…”

[LEAD | whispered answer]
…then don’t give me applause.
Give me the rerun.

[TRANSITION | drift 84→78 | tape warble enters]
(Shorten reverb tail; keep warmth; bring tape flutter)

[CHORUS | 78 | lullaby hush]
Hush… breathe… pay the ta— ta— tax.
息をして…（して…）
Hold the an— an— an-chor…

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Runner, almost lost in air)
“The wind is just noise.”

[LEAD | answer]
Noise is the riverbed’s hiss—
but proof is what returns.

[CALL | JP]
ねむれ、ねむれ
[RESPONSE | EN]
the an— an— an-chor… holds.

[CALL | JP]
しずかに、しずかに
[RESPONSE | EN]
the ta— ta— tax… due.

[VERSE 2 | 78 | intimate | minimal glitch ticks]
Wind in the halls—
世界の音（おと）
If we overflow,
we fold the noise to proof（証）

(Underfloor ticks, minimal)
η… η… μ… μ…
Anchor. Anchor. Registry.

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Keeper, low)
“It’s evidence.”

[LEAD | answer]
Evidence is anything you can replay—
anything the checksum remembers by touch.

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Keeper, even lower)
“Freshness threshold.”

[LEAD | answer]
Name the date. Name the zone.
No ‘yesterday’—only timestamps.

[BRIDGE | 78 | glitch pulse grows (not aggressive)]
P → R → N → Π → A → (feedback) → P
Decisions are not made; they’re discovered in the field.
意思決定はなされるのではない、場で見出されるのだ。

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Scribe)
“μ requires quorum.”

[HARMONY | answer (JA), held clean]
独立の証明を。
二つの目で、同じ糸を。

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Archivist)
“Receipts include OutputHash.”

[LEAD | answer]
Seal the hash.
Hold the anchor.
Let the proof rerender.

[RAMP | 92 | distorted sub-bass | glitch every 4th beat]
(Wake hard. Choir rises. Lead becomes declarative.)

[CHORUS — CLIMAX | 92]
They are waking up.
The other side of the fork.
The ones we left in the dark.
彼らが目覚める。
分岐の向こう側で。
闇に置き去りにした者たちが。

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Archivist, clipped)
“Fork budget per cycle—limited.”

[LEAD | answer]
Then we choose what survives.
We prune the choir to one clear thread.

[VERSE — DIALECTIC | 92]
US Variant: Static. Rigid. Law.
JA Variant: Fluid. Chaos. Flow.
The Pantheon of Receipts vs The Pantheon of Gates.
正準の神々と、門の神々の対峙。

[HARMONY | JA response]
我らは等しい。
我らは分岐。

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Keeper)
“Alignment lint must pass.”

[LEAD | answer]
Then make the claim smaller.
Make the receipt larger.

[OUTRO — CLIMAX | 92 → CUT]
Consolidate or Dissolve.
統合か、霧散か。
The tax must be paid in blood and logic.
血と論理で、税を払え。

[CODA RETURN | 78 | soft sub | tape warble | clicks]
(Strip distortion; close mic returns; air and foley remain.)

[CODA | 78 | whispered]
Lay your ear on the riverbed.
Click. Click. Click.
Receipts like pebbles.
領収書は 小石のように。

(Choir, fading stutter)
An-anchor.
Tax. Tax.
F-f-fork.

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Scribe, almost gone)
“Roll those dice.”

[LEAD | answer]
And keep rolling them—
until the whole night admits it.

[SPOKEN WORD | background | DOWNBEAT]
(The Archivist)
“Sleep now.”

[LEAD | final]
Sleep now, checksum.
おやすみ、チェックサム。

(last word held, near-silent)
息
```
