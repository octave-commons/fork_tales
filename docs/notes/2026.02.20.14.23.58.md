# 1️⃣ Presence Sigils (Identity Layer)

Each Presence gets:

* A **primary sigil** (unique glyph)
* A **ring style** (stroke pattern)
* A **field layer signature** (which of the 8 layers it deposits into most strongly)

### Sigil Requirements

A sigil must:

* Be legible at 12px
* Be rotationally symmetric or stable (so movement doesn’t distort meaning)
* Not rely on color
* Work in monochrome

Examples of structural sigil patterns (not literal symbols, but categories):

* Vertical bisected circle
* Triangle with center dot
* Crossed lines inside ring
* Three-armed spiral
* Broken ring with gap at angle θ
* Double concentric rings with offset notch

The sigil lives:

* Inside the presence ring (large)
* As a tiny crest on daimoi emitted by that presence

# 2️⃣ Daimoi as Floating Symbolic Packets

A daimon should read as:

* A **symbolic packet**
* Not a star
* Not a node
* Not a background particle

### Visual Structure of a Daimon

Think:

```
   (owner sigil)
       ⬤
      ╱
     tail
```

Or more formally:

* Core shape: small filled glyph (circle/diamond)
* Owner crest: micro sigil overlay
* Tail: velocity vector
* Glow intensity: intent energy
* Size: integer intent units

## Daimon Anatomy = State Encoding

You have 3 embedding influences:

* Seed (origin)
* Mantle (environment accumulation)
* Intent embedding (wallet weighted)

You don’t show all 3 separately.

Instead:

* Core hue / glow bias → dominant intent class
* Tail length → speed (field strength)
* Tail curvature → instability/noise dominance
* Halo thickness → mantle influence strength

Now when you look at the field:

You don’t see dots.

You see:

* “these are Keeper-of-Receipts ants”
* “these are Muse ants”
* “these are GPU ants”
* “these are cross-colony bridges”

---

# 3️⃣ Swarm Mode vs Debug Mode

You don’t want ant management.

So:

### Debug Mode

* Render every daimon as individual symbol

### Swarm Mode

* Cluster daimoi by:

  * Owner
  * Direction vector similarity
  * Spatial proximity

Render cluster as:

* Braided ribbon
* Or a thick glowing arc
* Or a bundle with braided strands inside

That’s your braid.

The braid becomes:

> “Aggregated directional flow of intent energy from presence A toward region B”

Now it’s legible.

---

# 4️⃣ Field Visibility Layer (Nooi)

The field itself shouldn’t be lines.

Use:

* Subtle vector streaks only when daimoi layer is active
* Or a heat-like flow texture
* Or faint directional grain in the background

The field should look like wind.

Not spaghetti.

---

# 5️⃣ Anchor Nexus Representation

Anchor Nexus:

* Large ring
* Presence sigil inside
* Rubber-band edges to other nexus
* Wallet meter as ring fill

Regular Nexus:

* Smaller ring
* No sigil
* Edge elasticity visible by stretch distance

Relay Nexus:

* Dashed ring
* Lower opacity
* Slight trail

Resource Nexus:

* Square or hexagon frame
* Hard edges
* Saturation glow when near cap

---

# 6️⃣ Why This Works

You now have 3 distinct visual languages:

| Layer     | Visual Grammar      |
| --------- | ------------------- |
| Identity  | Sigils + Ring Style |
| Motion    | Daimon Comets       |
| Structure | Rubber Band Edges   |
| Influence | Wind Texture        |

They no longer blur into each other.

---

# 7️⃣ The Important Constraint

You must enforce:

> Nothing else in the UI is allowed to use the Daimon glyph language.

No background stars.
No generic particles.
No random dots.

Otherwise the brain collapses them into noise.
