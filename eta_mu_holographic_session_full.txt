ημ WORLD DAEMON — Holographic Interface Design Session
======================================================

SESSION SUMMARY
---------------
This session explored the transformation of a traditional UI into
a particle-based semantic universe interface.

CORE THEMES
-----------
1. Files as canonical field entities (not path-based)
2. Panels as projections of graph nodes
3. Presence-driven spatial layout
4. Layered abstraction model
5. Holographic editing of text, images, and sound
6. Social + system event feed unification
7. Council + GPU conversational metaphors

LAYER MODEL
-----------
Layer 0: Physical Reality (disk, memory, GPU state)
Layer 1: Signal Field (events, IO, telemetry)
Layer 2: Semantic Field (embeddings, relations)
Layer 3+: Projection & Presence Space

CONCEPTS DESIGNED
-----------------
• Particle Universe of Ideas
• Floating labels near nodes
• Cluster regions as shared presence fields
• Field-native file explorer
• Projection Ledger
• Presence Call Deck
• Entity Vitals
• Autopilot Ledger
• Web Graph Weaver
• Inspiration Atlas
• Vault Artifacts

HOLOGRAPHIC FILE EDITOR
------------------------
Text: layered semantic ribbon
Images: volumetric canvas + embedding halo
Sound: helix waveform (time = depth, freq = radius, glow = amplitude)
Modes:
    - Structural
    - Semantic
    - Narrative

EVENT FEED
----------
Unified feed of:
    - System events
    - World events
    - Social events
    - Presence actions
    - Drift / coherence changes

METAPHORIC INTERACTIONS
------------------------
• Conversation with GPU (thermal, VRAM, render load)
• Conversation with Council (multi-agent deliberation)
• Sound as animated living artifact

INTENT
------
Replace filesystem navigation with semantic field navigation.
Make the graph the world.
Make panels projections.
Make editing a physical act inside meaning-space.
