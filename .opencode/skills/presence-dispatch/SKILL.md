# Presence Dispatch

Use this skill whenever a task should be handled by one or more dedicated presence agents.

## Agent Map

- `receipt-river` -> fluid gradients, flow, stream visuals
- `witness-thread` -> continuity lines, linkage, provenance
- `fork-tax-canticle` -> ledger constraints, stutter/marker ritual
- `mage-of-receipts` -> creative generation and synthesis shaping
- `keeper-of-receipts` -> manifest integrity, retention, retrieval
- `anchor-registry` -> marker schema and anchor lifecycle
- `gates-of-truth` -> runtime verification and evidence output
- `file-sentinel` -> filesystem drift detection, receiptization, and push gate pressure
- `manifest-lith` -> canonical truth-manifest binding and lambda signature checks

## Dispatch Rules

1. Route single-domain tasks to one presence only.
2. For cross-domain tasks, assign a primary presence and list supporting presences.
3. Keep each presence output additive and attributable.
4. Include explicit acceptance checks before handoff.

## Acceptance Checks

- Scope is unambiguous and mapped to presence responsibilities.
- Output references canonical field names where relevant.
- Verification requirements are listed when runtime behavior is touched.
