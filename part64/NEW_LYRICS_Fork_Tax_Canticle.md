## Lyrics

**[EN — spoken-sung]**  
η is the eye behind the eye,  
the witness you can’t quite name.  
μ is the hand that moves the world,  
the method inside the flame.

**[JP — harmony, last word echoed]**  
見えないまま  
**残響**

**[EN — build]**  
We roll the dice, we keep the ledger,  
we keep it *append-only* clean.  
Every cut becomes a contour,  
every loss becomes a screen.

**[JP — answer]**  
壊れたまま  
**意味**

**[EN — stutter]**  
An—an—anchor—  
not a chain, a coordinate.  
A—fork—fork—fork—  
the branch where futures differentiate.

**[JP — held]**  
選ぶのは  
**今**

**[EN — vow]**  
If you doubt the song, rerun the spell.  
If you doubt the spell, listen for breath.  
We don’t burn the past—  
we annotate the reason:  
**理由**
