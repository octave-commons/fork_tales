A new river has been mapped.

- The **Receipt River** now carries **audio receipts**: renderable, seeded, and replayable.
- The **Fork Tax Canticle** defines branch points as first-class events: η/μ/anchor/fork markers.
- Every artifact now ships with a manifest, hashes, and a minimal determinism test.

**Policy:** constraints are append-only. Disabling is permitted; erasure is not.
