NOTICE
======

This repository uses a dual-licensing model to ensure both code and creative 
works remain free and share-alike.

LICENSE SELECTION
-----------------

Code and Technical Works
  All source code, scripts, configurations, and technical artifacts are 
  licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0 or later (GPL-3.0+).

  See: LICENSE.txt

  This includes but is not limited to:
  - Python files (.py)
  - TypeScript/JavaScript files (.ts, .tsx, .js, .mjs)
  - Lisp files (.lisp)
  - Configuration files (.json, .jsonc, .yml, .yaml)
  - Build scripts and tooling

Creative Works
  All creative, literary, artistic, and narrative works are licensed under 
  the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International license 
  (CC BY-SA 4.0).

  See: LICENSE_CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt

  This includes but is not limited to:
  - Markdown files (.md) containing lore, lyrics, narratives
  - SVG images and graphics
  - Documentation (excluding code comments)
  - Promethean protocol specifications (when treated as creative work)
  - Song lyrics and creative writing

SPDX IDENTIFIERS
----------------

To identify the license of any file, look for the SPDX license identifier:

  Code files:
    # SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
    ;; SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: GPL-3.0-or-later

  Creative files:
    SPDX-License-Identifier: CC-BY-SA-4.0

RATIONALE
---------

This dual-licensing approach ensures:

1. Code remains free and open source under GPL-3.0+, requiring any 
   derivative works to also be open source.

2. Creative works remain share-alike under CC BY-SA 4.0, allowing 
   remixing and commercial use while requiring attribution and 
   sharing under the same license.

3. The distinction between "code" and "creative" reflects the different 
   nature of each type of work: code is functional/technical while 
   creative works are expressive/narrative.

COMBINING CODE AND CREATIVE WORKS
---------------------------------

When combining GPL-licensed code with CC-BY-SA-licensed creative works:

- Code that incorporates creative works must maintain GPL licensing
- Creative works embedded in or generated by code retain CC-BY-SA licensing
- The more restrictive license (GPL) typically applies to the combination

For questions about licensing, please consult the individual license 
texts or seek legal advice.
